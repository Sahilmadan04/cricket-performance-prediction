# Cricket Performance Prediction

This project aims to predict the performance of international cricket players in upcoming ODI and T20I matches using historical data and machine learning models.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `data/` — Contains raw and processed cricket datasets (ODI & T20I).
- `notebooks/` — Jupyter Notebooks for EDA and model development.
- `src/` — Python modules for preprocessing, EDA, and model training.
- `models/` — Trained models saved for future predictions.
- `outputs/` — Includes charts, reports, and exported results.
- `main.py` — Script to run the end-to-end prediction pipeline.

## 📊 Data Sources

All stats are scraped and verified from **ESPN Cricinfo** (2025).

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run your notebook from `notebooks/` or execute the main script:
